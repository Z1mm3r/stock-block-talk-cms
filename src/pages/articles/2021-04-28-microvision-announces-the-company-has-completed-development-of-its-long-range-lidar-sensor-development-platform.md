Microvision has announced the completion of its A-Sample hardware and development platform. The piece of hardware is a key part of their LIDAR system, and seems to boast an impressive feature list.

As quoted from their press release which can be found [here](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-completion-its-long-range-lidar-sensor) “With an expected range of 250 meters and a field of view of 100 degrees horizontal by 30 degrees vertical, we expect this lidar sensor to provide the highest resolution point cloud at 10.8 million points per second while operating at 30 hertz…We believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature. ”

The release follows weeks of rumors that Microvision would be preparing an announcement on their sensors. This announcement seems to add validity to these claims, with other rumors still circulating about the company.

Microvision has been on a wild ride as of late, with shares adding almost 50% some days within the last week as it gained extreme popularity among online trading forums.

The company is expected to announce earnings tomorrow.
