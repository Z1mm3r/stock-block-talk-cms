**Breaking News:**  One of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world is about to go public and it seems the market can’t wait to get in. The date of the public listing is set for today 4/14 under the ticker ‘COIN’ and aims to open trading at a valuation of about $100 billion.

Coinbase's share price of $350 would indicate a 40% increase over its reference price of $250. The reference price is not a hard value, but rather a benchmark to give the days trading values to start at.
