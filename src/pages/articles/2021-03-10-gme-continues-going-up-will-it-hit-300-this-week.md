GameStop is having a wonderful month, shares are up from about $40 from the end of February rising to roughly $250 after hours today. The moves are a result of improved investor sentiment, following a series of announcements.

* GameStop shares were Up 27% Tuesday.

  * Shares were up 40% Monday.
* Comes after Multiple Announcements including C-Suite Shakeups.

  * Jim Bell, GameStop’s Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) announced he will be resigning from his roles on March 26, 2021.
  * GameStop announced a new Strategy Committee to find ways to move into the multi-billion dollar video game e-commerce market.
  * GameStop’s Largest Shareholder, Ryan Cohen will be leading the new committee.

It seems that the company is looking to rotate into more of an e-commerce market. This makes sense given the shift from physical to digital sales over the last console generation. Digital content for consoles is expected to hold almost 3x the market cap of physical sales worldwide by 2022, giving an estimated market cap of $34 Billion for these online sales.
