Gamestop investors across the market are rejoicing after the stock had an absolutely outrageous day. After news of the CFO resigning broke the night before, the stock received a small bump on the price. Bouncing between 4%-10% for the day most holders were already happy with the price. Then 3pm EST came around and BOOM.



* Jim Bell, Gamestop’s Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) announced he will be resigning from his roles on March 26, 2021.
* Gamestop stock was the center of the market’s attention towards the 2nd half of January, as the stock price soared from roughly $20 a share to over $400.
* The move was attributed to a massive short squeeze , where speculators bet on Gamestop's price going down, but lost money as it went up. Forcing them to close their position by buying stock and push the price even higher.

Once 3pm came around without much warning Gamestop went on a tear. Within one hour the stock went from ~$50 to over $90 with the ticker being halted by circuit breakers multiple times, eventually halting into close. The price action was so sudden, sites like Reddit which houses discussion groups including WallStreetBets was completely taken down from the traffic.



Trading after hours had the stock up over $180 per share, doubling the stock again and bringing the one day price action to around 400%.
