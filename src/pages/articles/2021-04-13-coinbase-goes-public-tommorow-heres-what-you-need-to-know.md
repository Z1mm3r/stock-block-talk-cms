One of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world is about to go public and it seems the market can’t wait to get in. The date of the public listing is set for 4/14 under the ticker ‘COIN’ and aims to open trading at a valuation of about $100 billion. But can the company justify such a high price?

### **What is Coinbase?**

Coinbase has been around since 2012, however over time it has become one of the most dominant exchanges for cryptocurrency. On it users can buy and sell a number of different cryptocurrencies, and can also withdraw their proceeds into fiat currency. The liquidity and massive number of potential new buyers creates what is known as the ‘coinbase effect’, which is when a new cryptocurrency is listed on Coinbase its value skyrockets. With over 43 Million users as of March 2021 it's not hard to see how.

#### **The One Hundred Billion Question**

However it's yet to be seen how the market will react to such a pricey listing and traders are sure to ask the question if it's worth the asking price. Let's take a quick look at some of the financials they’ve released.

* Coinbase’s net income for 2020 was $322.3 million, versus the $30.4 million net loss of 2019.
* Nasdaq, one of the largest exchanges in the world had net income of $933 million for 2020, the company trades at a roughly $26 billion dollar market cap.

Comparing the two is harder than looking at simple net income to market cap ratios, but it can show how frothy Coinbase’s launch day market cap looks. Another question interested buyers may want to know is how the stock will trade in regards to bitcoin’s daily moves. There are a number of crypto related trades on us exchanges already including Canaan Creative, Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings & more. These stocks can see wild swings with the volatility of bitcoin and have seen massive run ups with the over 100% increase year over year of bitcoins price.

##### **Should you invest in COIN when it opens?**

Investors should assume that COIN will be a highly speculative play. Not only is the company’s price tag already extremely high, but the main source of Coinbase’s income comes from exchange fees on an extremely volatile asset. This could cause large amounts of volatility on Coinbase itself, and one should ask themselves what kind of growth they can expect from the company going forward.
