Saying Microvision has been on a hot streak would be the understatement of the month. Since a 52-week low of just 24 cents the stock has been propelled up to as much as $28.00 during market hours. This comes after becoming one of the darling stocks on trading forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.

However, the last few days it has gone parabolic. Going from roughly 10 dollars to its new 52 week high of $28.00 has also brought a huge number of speculators to the stock, with the volume of mentions on Stocktwits growing exponentially. The move even made its way to Jim Cramer’s Mad Money broadcast, where the T.V star sided with the online traders. “I’d rather be on the long side than the short side’ he said.

The stock was higher after hours Monday, seeing it rise to over 15% reaching $30 per share. However, even with the encouragement the stock couldn't seem to hold these gains into Tuesday's session. By 9:45 am, the stock was trading in extremely negative territory.

Will this be all for the MVIS blastoff for now? Or does this stock have more room to run? With earnings on Thursday, plenty of traders are still ready to ride the stock out and roll the dice. If the company is able to show good results for its LIDAR systems perhaps the stock will have yet another massive run.
