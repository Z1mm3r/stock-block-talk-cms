### What is Coinbase?

Coinbase has been around since 2012, however over time it has become one of the most dominant exchanges for cryptocurrency. On it users can buy and sell a number of different cryptocurrencies, and can also withdraw their proceeds into fiat currency.

### Does Coinbase justify its $85 Billion Dollar Market Cap?

However it's yet to be seen how the market will react to such a pricey listing and traders are sure to ask the question if it's worth the asking price. Let's take a quick comparison to another exchange (albeit for stocks) located in the U.S, Nasdaq.

* Coinbase’s net income for 2020 was $322.3 million, versus the $30.4 million net loss of 2019.
* Nasdaq, one of the largest exchanges in the world had net income of $933 million for 2020, the company trades at a roughly $26 billion dollar market cap.

Comparing two companies is harder than simply looking at net income to market cap ratios, but it can show how speculative Coinbase’s launch day market cap looks. Another question interested buyers may want to know is how the stock will trade in regards to bitcoin’s daily moves. There are a number of crypto related trades on us exchanges already including Canaan Creative, Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings & more. These stocks can see wild swings with the volatility of bitcoin and have seen massive run ups with the over 100% increase year over year of bitcoin's price.



### Future Profitability of Coinbase

It is important to note that although the company has seen massive growth on its earnings, it faces numerous challenges ahead. Coinbase charges users fees as high as 1.5% of a transaction. As more crypto exchanges navigate through U.S regulations, this will certainly come down as competition increases. This could seriously reduce the future revenue of the company.

### Should you invest in COIN now?

Investors should assume that COIN will be a highly speculative play. Not only is the company’s price tag already extremely high, but the main source of Coinbase’s income comes from exchange fees on an extremely volatile asset. This could cause large amounts of volatility on Coinbase itself, and one should ask themselves what kind of growth they can expect from the company going forward.
